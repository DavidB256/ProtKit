ProtKit is a suite of bioinformatics tools for working with .pdb files. It includes the ProtKit Scripting Language (PKSL). It was created by David Bass for the 2021 Virginia iGEM team.

ProtKit was created as an open-source tool to grant structural biologists greater control over the files that they work with. It brings a number of utilities together into one user-friendly program. ProtKit serves as a PKSL interpreter, allowing users to easily manipulate and combine .pdb files.

ProtKit is written in C++17.
