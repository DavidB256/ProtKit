ProtKit is a suite of bioinformatics tools for working with .pdb files. It was created by David Bass for the 2021 Virginia iGEM team.

ProtKit was created as an open-source tool to grant structural biologists greater control over the files that they work with. It brings a number of utilities together into one user-friendly program.

ProtKit is written in C++17.
