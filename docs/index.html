    <h1>ProtKit 1.0</h1>
    <p>By David Bass</p>
    <p>Last updated 7 July 2021</p>
    <h3>Welcome to ProtKit</h3>
    <p>ProtKit is a suite of tools for working with .pdb files. It includes the ProtKit Scripting Language (PKSL). It was created by David Bass to assist with the modeling efforts of the 2021 Virginia iGEM team.</p>
    <h3>Why ProtKit?</h3>
    <p>ProtKit was created as an open-source tool to grant structural biologists greater control over the files that they work with. It brings a number of utilities together into one user-friendly program. Think of it like data science, but for proteins.</p>
